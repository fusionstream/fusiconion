# **Readme**

I put this together so we'd have a common and recognisable set of icons across as many BitFocus Companion users as possible. 

The designs are intentionally done to make it easy to spot at a glance.

### **How to use**
By default, all generated icon files are available in the <mark>*Generated*</mark> folder which is a folder of shortcuts to the various <mark>*Generatives/theIconSetYouWant/theIconSetYouWant-assets/*</mark> folders.

If you want to make changes or regenerate an iconset:
1. Download all files.
2. Navigate to <mark>*Generatives/theIconSetYouWant*</mark> and open <mark>*theIconSetYouWant**Generative***</mark>.psd
- The PSD file make use of Photoshop's automatic Image Assets Generator function so **any changes made are rendered and exported immediately** in the earlier mentioned folder (note: watch out for bugs, it's not perfect; in particular, cropped or wrongly sized icons)
- Various linked PSD files are used such 1x **Base** and 1x **partialBase**
- Most iconsets use global overlays (such as common Freeze and Cut overlays) while some such as the *PPT iconset* also include their own **Overlays** and indeed **Underlays**. The local overlays can be found in the same folder as the PSD file while Global Overlays are found one folder up in the **Global Overlays** folder
