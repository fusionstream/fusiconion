fusIconIon - is FUSionstream's ICONs for companION

I put this together so we'd have a common and recognisable set of icons across as many BitFocus Companion users as possible. 

I'm no designer but I've tried my best to make it unique enough that it should be easy to spot at a glance. Ideas are welcome.

### **How to use**
By default, all generated icon files are available in the <mark>***Generated***</mark> folder which contains shortcuts to the various <mark>***Generatives/theIconSetYouWant/theIconSetYouWant-assets/***</mark> folders.

If you want to make changes or regenerate an iconset:
1. Download all files.
2. Navigate to <mark>*Generatives/theIconSetYouWant*</mark> and open <mark>*theIconSetYouWant**Generative***</mark>.psd
- The PSD file make use of Photoshop's automatic Image Assets Generator function so **any changes made are rendered and exported immediately** in the earlier mentioned folder (note: watch out for bugs, it's not perfect; in particular, cropped or wrongly sized icons)
- Various linked PSD files are used such 1x **Base** and 1x **partialBase**
- Most iconsets use global overlays (such as common Freeze and Cut overlays) while some such as the *PPT iconset* also include their own **Overlays** and indeed **Underlays**. The local overlays can be found in the same folder as the PSD file while Global Overlays are found one folder up in the **Global Overlays** folder
